Sprint Challenge: Advanced CSS & Introduction to JavaScript


1. How would you describe acessibility on the web to someone new to programming?
Accessibility is the way that programmers create websites that are friendly to persons
with disabilities such as blindness or others. These methods can include having meaningful
alt descriptions for all images on the website, having a good balance of colors that are
easy on the eyes (so to speak), using structural HTML (e.g. main, section, p, aside, etc.). 

2. Talk about 3 different things you can do to ensure your website is accessible.
Use the methods mentioned in question 2: structural HTML, meaningful alt descriptions, 
easy-to-read fonts and colors, and maybe even providing your own audio for all text.

3. How would you explain the concept of a variable to someone new to programming?
A variable can be defined as var/let/const in JS. These types are then declared a name 
such as var firstName. This newly declared variable, firstName, is then assigned a value,
such as var firstName = "Jonah". Variables hold values (e.g. numbers, strings (text 
inside ""), arrays, objects, and others I have probably not yet learned. Variables are a
simple concept: something that is a placeholder for something else that lessens the work
for the programmer and keeps things organized in the code for the computer and programmer.

4. What is the purpose of using functions in code?
Functions in code get the JS code to do more with the data in the code (e.g. the variables).
Functions are there to execute a specific task or tasks, and they must be called from
outside the function {} in order for the function to return/show any solutions or actions.
